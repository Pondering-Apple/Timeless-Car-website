          The <span className="font-bold text-2xl">McLaren F1</span> was
          McLaren's first ever solo production car, and it is a car to be
          remembered. Its price of US$815,000 made it one of the most expensive
          cars of its era, but it had a good reason.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The McLaren F1 was the fastest car in the world when it was released
          in 1992. It held that record for 13 years until it was beaten by the
          Bugatti Veyron in 2005. However, it still remains the fastest car with
          a naturally aspirated engine. Its 6.1 Litre V12 engine produced 618
          hp, making the car capable of reaching up to 240.1 mph (386.4 km/h),
          surpassing the previous record by 23 mph (37 km/h).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The F1 had a unique interior setup, providing 3 seats, with the driver
          in the middle and 2 passengers on either side and further back. The
          car was also the first production car to have a carbon fibre
          monocoque, making it much lighter than its rivals.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This car is a record-breaker, incorporating next-generation technology
          and pushing the limits. It was perfected with the help of Formula 1
          legend Ayrton Senna. With the record of being the fastest car and the
          genes of F1, it is no wonder it has become one of the most expensive
          cars ever sold at auction, fetching upwards of US$20 million.
