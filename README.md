Deciding on the technology for this assignment initially seemed straightforward. I opted for REACT, a widely used front-end library/framework, as it presented a valuable learning opportunity given its wide use in the industry. However, selecting a topic proved to be more challenging. Drawing from my interests in cars and photography, I aimed to revisit a previous attempt at creating a website centered around these themes, knowing my skills have improved.

In terms of front-end concepts, I primarily leveraged JavaScript XML (JSX), the cornerstone of REACT for creating HTML-like code. Additionally, I integrated the CSS framework Tailwind CSS. Initially unable to understand why Tailwind existed, combining Tailwind CSS with REACT provided me with deeper insights into its practical applications and versatility.

The most significant hurdle I encountered was navigating the large amount of resources available for learning REACT. The abundance of guides and setup options initially left me feeling overwhelmed. However, with help from Ben, who recommended a good resource to learn from, I gained confidence and eventually stumbled upon a particularly instructive video tutorial. While structuring the website's content and layout proved relatively straightforward once I grasped REACT fundamentals, transforming it from a static site to a dynamic one posed a considerable challenge. Implementing JavaScript functionality within the REACT framework proved more complex than anticipated, as achieving desired changes wasn't as intuitive as in traditional HTML-based websites.

Alongside REACT, I also utilised GitHub Co-Pilot and ChatGPT (Github for debugging/fixing and Chatgpt for information as well as some coding). These AI tools proved helpful in debugging and developing my website. GitHub Co-Pilot was extremely helpful in the deployment process and trying to push it to GitHub and get it working. REACT doesn't work so well with GitHub, so trying to get the website working was a very difficult and time consuming task that I probably could not of done without it. During some stages of building the website, I relied on it too heavily and allowed it to suggest silly changes/"fixes" to my website

Looking ahead, I aim to refine my skills in REACT and explore additional tools like to streamline development processes. Embracing AI tools was very beneficial over all, presenting me with more helpful ideas than unhelpful.
